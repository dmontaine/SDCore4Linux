"""test-toolaudit-units.py - the audit trail page, TOOL.AUDIT (`gpl.bp/tool_audit`), and its reader $AUDIT_READ (`gpl.bp/audit_read`), as invariants read off the source (S.75, administrator
app A5).  Free: no install, no sudo, no sd.

    python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-toolaudit-units.py [--selftest]

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.  It reads the two programs' BASIC as text, with comments removed.  ***IT RUNS NOTHING, SO IT CANNOT SAY THAT THE PAGE SHOWS THE FILE'S LINES***: that is
`sandbox-tool-audit.py` (a private SD, a fixture audit file of 1,500 lines, a Python reader written from the line format, and the lines the page saves read back from the disk).  What a text
check is for: the properties that make the page a READER and not a second way to change anything - the reader asks the kernel for the administrator before it touches a file, opens only a
file whose name is audit or audit.yyyymmdd-hhmmss in the system directory, opens it for reading only, and reads it from the end in blocks; the page runs no command, and its one write is
the record X makes in the administrator's own $HOLD file, followed by its audit line.  Those are mostly ORDER and ABSENCE, and an edit that moves one still compiles.

--selftest breaks each invariant in the way an edit plausibly would and requires a check to notice; a mutant that nothing catches is a failure of the self-test.
